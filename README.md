# Health Analysis

Over the past two years I've gathered a variety of information.  Some of this information is in totality of those two years, most isnt.
* A picture of every meal I've eaten
* A caption describing the contents of the meal
* My weight every morning
* Time and classification of my bowel movements
* Workouts at my weightlifting gym

This project is the initiative to
* digitize and clean all the collected data,
* analyse the data,
* build models to predict future behavior,
* streamline the extension of datasets,
* visualize the data and analysis,
* and report on what I've learned as a result of analysis.
